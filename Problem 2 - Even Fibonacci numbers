# Problem Statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# R Code
##----------------------##

# set first occurance of the fibonacci series
a <- 1
# set second occurance of the fibonacci series
b <- 2
# initialize sum to be zero
sum <- 0
# initialize even_sum to be 2 - first even number in the fibonacci series
even_sum <- 2

# run the loop till the sum is less than 4 million
while(sum <= 4000000)
{
  sum = a + b
  a <- b
  b <- sum
  
  # check the condition for even number of sum i.e. next fibonacci value and it is less than 4 million
  if(((sum %% 2 == 0) && (sum < 4000000)) == TRUE)
  {
    even_sum <- even_sum + sum
  } 
}

##----------------------##

# Solution variable: even_sum = 4613732
